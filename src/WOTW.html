<h2 align="center" class="poemtitle">Will o' The Wisp</h2>
<p align="center">
  I was a traveller, <br>
  Treading chains of roads,<br>
Not knowing where to go.<br>
But that night as I walked under the starless sky,<br>
I was followed by a dreadful roar of my past.<br>
My chaotic mind wandered in every direction,<br>
My fearful heart trembled within its cage,<br>
My eyes shut praying the lord,<br>
When they opened, they saw<br>
Will o’ the Wisp<br>
Burning blue in the mist,<br>
Calling upon my name melodiously,<br>
I heard rumours of getting lost following this little ghost fire<br>
But I could see no light guiding me either.<br>
As the roar amplified,<br>
I followed the trail of blue flames into the dark forest<br>
That stood eerily lifeless.<br>
  <br><img class="img-wisp" src="../img/willowisp2.jpg" align="left" height="700" width="504"><br>
Of course the tales of the night fires were true,<br>
Will o’ the Wisp<br>
Made me run deeper into the maze of despair,<br>
And there I stood now, in the middle of nowhere<br>
In the middle of five mirrors that pillared around me.<br>
I saw myself in each of them,<br>
Each of them smiling at me,<br>
“You love me, don’t you?” asked the one bearing innocence of a child.<br>
“Are you afraid of yourself?” asked my mirror twin with a twisted smile.<br>
“Rein me before I go wild.” ordered the one with raging eyes.<br>
“The dawn will soon arise!” said the one with a hopeful light.<br>
“Give time a chance to show you the light!” said the one with a solemn voice.<br>
I stood there perplexed, absorbing the series of sentences.<br>
And when I looked up,<br>
I was alone again,<br>
Darkness had as though grown a little older<br>
As its shade scaled up by another number<br>
I heard again the roar, growing stronger<br>
But Will o’ the Wisp was nowhere to be found!<br>
Now that I was drowned further,<br>
I sat down devoid of hope,<br>
Just when the monster reached behind me,<br>
A voice rang in my head,<br>
“The dawn will soon arise!”<br>
And for one last time I opened my eyes<br>
To see a blue flame burning in the mist,<br>
It was will o’ the wisp!<br>
But this time it followed behind me<br>
Towards the monster I feared.<br>
“Are you afraid of yourself?”<br>
Another voice rang and within me<br>
Courage fired.<br>
  <br><img class="img-willowisp" src="../img/willowisp5.jpg" align="right" height="504" width="404"><br>
My eyes slowly followed the light,<br>
To find the demon standing behind,<br>
It was me!<br>
Bearing bright brown eyes,<br>
A contagious smile,<br>
And her face so carefree, like a child,<br>
Her aura shined like a halo around her.<br>
I secretly wished to be like her.<br>
“This is indeed you dear!” she said<br>
“Don’t be surprised, you just lost your way!”<br>
Saying so she hugged me tight and whispered,<br>
“Those roars were the scars you held on tightly inside!”<br>
“Let go! Let them heal with time! Give time, a chance to show you the light!”<br>
Her words rung like an alarm in my head<br>
I was lost in the forest of despair.<br>
Now I realise why will o’ the wisp brought me here<br>
To lose the path that forbade me to find myself<br><br>
Now I am a traveller,<br>
Treading chains of roads,<br>
Just exactly knowing where to go!<br>
