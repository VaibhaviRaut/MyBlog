<div class="poem">
<h2 align="center" class="poemtitle">Crown</h2><br>
<p align="center">
There once was a kingdom<br>
Called life<br>
There lived a Queen<br>
She sat on her decorated throne<br>
And wore a crown bearing a single stone<br>
There were varieties of visits<br>
Some left lessons<br>
Some left memories<br>
As their gifts<br>
Among them came disguised foes<br>
Who, conspired to exploit the Queen's<br>
Handicap, sole<br>
They offered mighty words and flashy colored stones<br>
To attach to her simple crown<br>
Her simple soul<br>
Little did she know<br>
It was the beginning of her downfall<br>
Variety came thereon<br>
Both friend and foes<br>
But the Queen was unaware of the slightest weight<br>
Gradually burdening her crown with false pride<br>
And vain<br>
Under the false mighty praises they bestowed<br>
“You are the most magnificent of all<br>
With that priceless crown,<br>
You possess powers superior to all,<br>
You are the Queen most beautiful.”<br>
They said<br>
Her eyes veiled with the high tides of<br>
Misty gays<br>
Her ears deaf to all her<br>
Pure Counsels<br>
Her brain infected with<br>
Ego<br>
And thus began the reign of fire<br>
Severing all the bonds of friendships<br>
Instead of desire<br>
Demanding golden eggs like Midas<br>
To add to her already heavy crown<br>
And then the time came<br>
Her neck bent down<br>
With the weight that it gained<br>
Bearing her vulnerability with<br>
Knives pointed at her nape<br>
By the hands of those very mouths that showered<br>
Praise<br>
Now spouting their long plotted<br>
Plan<br>
That’s how the Queen lost all that she had<br>
Alas,<br>
Times are cruel not a fairytale<br>
Now long after <br>
In a village nearby<br>
Lived the wise old Counsel with children<br>
All ears to his tale <br>
About the kingdom<br>
Called life<br>
Which he ended tragically<br>
Yet with a smile<br>
As he taught the morals of abandoning<br>
Greed, <br>
Ego and pride<br>

"Weave your Words to create your own Legacy."
This is my motto. I am here in this world to do something, something that leaves a mark on the sands of time. Blessed with the art to use words I want to make a difference in the world. I want to create my own Identity, my own Legacy.
I know I am still a fledgling but this is my first step out of my nest into a world of new ventures and new things to learn. Thank you, WordPress for providing me with this platform to showcase my talents and share it with others and to know others' reviews.
