# MyBlog

A website to showcase my hobbies. Still in progress and a source for beginners to learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with me!
I've also used BootStrap and used parallex effect. 

Easy steps to access: 

-> Download the ZIP file or clone it.
-> Run MB_index.html to open it in a browser to view.

I haven't been able to upload it anywhere yet. Apologises for the trouble.

The video below will give you an idea of how it looks.

Hopefully this helps you!

Work in progress...
